                    Hello! I'm Vedant Sagare, a passionate individual dedicated to exploring the intersections of technology, research, and community service.<br><br>
                    Currently involved in quantum computing research at UC Berkeley, I'm driven by a curiosity for cutting-edge technologies like machine learning, which I apply to advance treatments for genetic diseases.<br><br>
                    My journey extends beyond the lab. As a martial artist with a third-degree black belt, I've competed in over 20 national tournaments, earning recognition on the esteemed "World Action Team" for martial arts excellence. I also champion initiatives like Phase 1, empowering young researchers globally to make a positive impact through their projects.<br><br>
                    From optimizing optical coherence tomography with deep learning for early disease detection to leading initiatives combating underage gambling with "Betting On Our Future Leader," my commitment to innovation and social responsibility continues to drive my endeavors. Whether in the realms of science, athletics, or community leadership, I strive to make a meaningful difference.
                  </p>

I was also selected by a martial arts hall of famer to be part of a team called the “World Action Team” that was once considered one of the best martial artists in the world. I have been selected by black belt hall of famer to perform in front of conventions and events with crowds of over 2000+ people. I was selected as the “Best Tester” out of 500+ black belt testers 3x time. I have been teaching at my martial arts school for over 3+ years. Got awards for this and published on Hindustan Times. Global Kids Awards. Graded at national tourneys. Got on Black Belt Mag</p>
